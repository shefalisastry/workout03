# Workout 03
## Submission by: Shefali Sastry

## This Workout was created for the STAT 133 class. The work here is a package called `binomial` which I created for our Workout 3 assignment.

## An Introduction to the Binomial Random Variable
 
#### This Binomial package calculates probabilities of a Binomial random variable because it allows us to calculate the probabilities to find the number of successes in a fixed number of random trials performed under identical conditions (assuming a constant probability of success on each trial).


## What this package contains

#### This specific package contains 15 functions that the user can use, 10 of which are main functions, and 5 of which are method functions that support these main functions due to their plotting capabilities. Here is a list of what is provided:


* Main Functions
    * `bin_choose()`
    * `bin_probability()`
    * `bin_distribution()`, Method: `plot.bindis()`
    * `bin_cumulative()`, Method: `plot.bincum()`
    * `bin_var()`, Method: `print.binvar()`
    * Summary/Auxiliary functions: `bin_mean()`, `bin_variance()`, `bin_mode()`, `bin_skewness()`, `bin_kurtosis()`
    
* Method Functions
    * `plot.bindis()`, 
    * `plot.bincum()`
    * `print.binvar()`
    * `summary.binvar()`
    * `print.summary.binvar()`
